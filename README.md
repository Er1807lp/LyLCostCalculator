Compile the Code yourself or use the Release version.

Put
- finalparts.txt
- middleparts.txt
- finaloverwriteparts.txt
in the same Folder as the .jar file

middleparts.txt has been filled from [dashboard.lifeyourlife.cc/crafting](https://dashboard.liveyourlife.cc/crafting)

finalparts.txt has been filled from [dashboard.lifeyourlife.cc/stoxx](https://dashboard.liveyourlife.cc/stoxx)

finaloverwriteparts.txt has been filled from missing Items for crafting.

You can edit the price of every Item. It will be saved in finaloverwriteparts.txt.

When editing a price, it replaces the recipe of that Item. This means you can't see the whole Item-Tree anymore.

## Currently arrow keys are bugged. Please use the mouse.
